    <h2 id="myName">Julie Janssen</h2>
    <p id="introText" style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">Welcome to my
        portfolio website, <br>
        My name is Julie Janssen. <br>
        I'm 18 years old and I study software <br>
        development at SintLucas in Eindhoven. <br>
        <br>
        My hobbies are writing stories, socializing, and <br>
        listening to music. <br>
        I want to become a game developer, but I'm also <br>
        very interested in web development. <br>
        The coding languages I've learned so far are: <br>
        C#, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
        <br>
        I also have a small base of Blender skills. These <br>
        skills can however be expanded if required. <br>
        The reason why you as a business might want to look <br>
        into hiring me is because I'm willing to <br>
        learn and try new things, I have a lot of respect <br>
        for others, and I'm always open to working in a team. <br>
        <br>
        Please feel more than welcome to look at the work <br>
        I'm showcasing on my website. <br>
        You can find my contact information on the contact page. <br>

    <p id="PongParagraph" style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        For this project I made a pong game using Unity and C# scripts. The goal of this project was to get familiar
        <br>
        with Unity and with the coding language C#. During this process I learned how to make objects in Unity (for <br>
        example the border), scene switching (from main menu to the actual game screen), I learned how to make a C# <br>
        script and how to use it, and how to use the particle system.

    <p id="AmbitionParagraph" style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        This project gave me as a student the perfect opportunity to learn new things and explore my own skills as well
        <br>
        as my flaws. In this project I decided to make a start with 3D modeling in Blender. This was a real challenge
        <br>
        for me, but I eventually got the hang of it. I managed to learn how to make different shapes, how to give them
        <br>
        different colors, how to make the player unable to fall/walk through the objects, I also learned how to use <br>
        different tools in Blender, and in the end I learned how to import the Blender files into Unity. This will be
        <br>
        useful for future projects in Blender, because now I have a small base to build upwards from.

    <p id="FirstPersonParagraph" style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">The
        first person shooter project taught me how to make objects spawn and how to turn
        them into the functioning <br>
        in-game enemies of the player. The other new skill that I developed during this project is to make terrains and
        <br>
        how to customize them. For the player scripts I learned to make it a functional player object which also carries
        <br>
        a speed and a camera point of view. In these scripts I used the C# coding language. I also learned how to adjust
        <br>
        the height of the player to the terrain it’s walking on and how to stop the player from going through the
        in-game objects.

    <p id="MobileGameParagraph" style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        For this project I attempted to make a mobile game for Android devices. I started by downloading assets and
        experimenting with their functions. <br>
        This way I was able to customize the controls and add my own elements as well. I added buttons which were meant
        to move the player to the left <br>
        or the right. I used C# coding language for that, but the camera was causing a lot of troubles meant that one of
        the buttons was out of frame. <br>
        The other problem was that the camera wouldn’t move an inch. This eventually became the end of the project, but
        even though the project itself <br>
        didn’t succeed. I was still able to learn how to use assets, how to figure out their functions and abilities,
        and I was able to find the things <br>
        I still had difficulties with (this gave me the chance to focus on these difficulties in the following project).

    <p id="MindfulWanderingParagraph"
       style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        During this project I made a game which allows the player to explore a peaceful surrounding environment. There
        are no activities for the player, <br>
        which allows them to truly find their peace while playing the game. The most difficult part of this project was
        to make the player and camera movement <br>
        work, which ended up being the part where the project stalled. I used scripts with C# coding language and I
        developed the game in Unity. <br>

    <p id="OnTheGoParagraph" style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        For this project I wanted to create an app that can give you information and tips on the mental struggles you’re
        facing or someone in your social <br>
        circle is facing. It is made with the coding language C# and was meant to be usable for mobile users. There were
        difficulties with the screen size, <br>
        letter size, and the scene switching. The scene switching is something I was able to work through for most
        scenes. I learned how to trust the process <br>
        and how to find the information I need online. <br>

        This project was my introduction to GitHub. I learned how to upload my projects to my GitHub profile and how to
        push changes to update it. During this project <br>
        I worked with the HTML, css, and Javascript coding languages. I worked with interactive surfaces the user can
        click on to get a dialogue to show up. The tile <br>
        map was made with PhotoShop and the objects were sized down and up to get to this result. <br>

       style="text-align: left; display:flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center">
        During the Ambition project I made a character in Blender. The goal I set for myself was to develop a simple
        base in the software, <br>
        so I would be able to use it in the <br>
        future. This turned out to be way more difficult than I expected, but it taught me how to actually follow
        tutorials and how to <br>
        explore the software on my own beforehand. <br>

        With this assignment I made a text based game that allows interaction from the user who can decide what <br>
        action they'll be doing to play through the story. I used the coding language C# for this project. <br>
        During this project I learned how to work with user input and how to change the story outcome based on that
        input.
