## Goals of this project
* Practice with CSS flexbox and grid
* Practise with Javascript

## Prerequisites
Basic HTML/CSS

## Analysis
* Write a proposal (use the template in the sintlucas folder) in which you describe the user stories, e.g.:
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a teaser, so that i am triggered to read more.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of projects, so that I can see what the student has done.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a contact form, so that I can contact the student.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a map, so that I can see where the student lives.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of skills, so that I can see which skills and knowledge the student has.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of education, so that I can see if the student has the right education for the job.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of applicable work experience, so that I can see what experience the student has.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a link to Github, so that I can see what code the student has written and to get an idea of his programming level.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of social media links, so that I can see where the student is active.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of languages, so that I can see what languages the student speaks.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I want to see a list of personality traits, so that I can see what the student is like.
    * As a *visitor of the website*, I expect another layout on a cell phone, so that it is still well readable.
* Let the teacher approve it.

## Design: UI design
Draw (paper or digital) a wireframe (put it in the sintlucas folder) that meets the user stories in the proposal.

## Design: technical design 
The techical design is given:
* A website consisting of one or more pages written in HTML/CSS and javascript.
* CSS flexbox and/or CSS grid to create the layout.
* Deployed on Github pages.
* Made responsive with media queries.

## Preparation
* Create a backlog (a list) with the user stories.
* Prioritize the items on the backlog: the most important items first.
* Refine each user story into smaller, more technical items.

## Development
* Start developing on the items, one by one.

Don't forget:
* Commit and push your changes regularly to prevent merge conflicts.
* Check the result in the browser regularly.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
* Make sure that your code follows the guidelines as described in sintlucas/style-guide-js.md

## Testing
* Test every finished item.
* Test your in different browsers and on different devices.

## Review
There will be a review moment in week 8:
* In English
* Show the result of each item on the beamer.

## Project evaluation
* During the lessons you will get feedback on your work.
* You will evaluate your own work.
* The teacher will evaluate your work.
